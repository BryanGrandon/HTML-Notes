```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- Tells the browser that the document is in HTML5 -->
<html lang="en">
  <!-- Represents the root of an HTML document -->
  <head>
    <!-- For information about the document -->
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Web site title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- For content -->
  </body>
</html>
```
